# PyQRCode


Python QR Code generator
=============================

Generate QR codes.

A standard install uses pypng_ to generate PNG files and can also render QR
codes directly to the console. A standard install is just::

    pip install qrcode

For more image functionality, install qrcode with the ``pil`` dependency so
that pillow_ is installed and can be used for generating images::

    pip install "qrcode[pil]"

.. _pillow: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow


What is a QR Code?
==================

A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used for its fast
readability and comparatively large storage capacity. The code consists of
black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The
information encoded can be made up of any kind of data (e.g., binary,
alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols)

Usage
=====

From the command line, use the installed ``qr`` script::

    qr "Some text" > test.png

Or in Python, use the ``make`` shortcut function:

.. code:: python

    import qrcode
    img = qrcode.make('Some data here')
    type(img)  # qrcode.image.pil.PilImage
    img.save("some_file.png")
